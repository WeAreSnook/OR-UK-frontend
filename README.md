# Release procedure

openreferraluk.org

This is a static website with files in s3, with cloudfront infront of that.

s3 urls are (both under the default aws account):
live: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/openreferraluk.org?region=eu-west-1&tab=objects
beta: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/beta.openreferraluk.org?region=eu-west-1&tab=objects

(I think it should be possible to use something like winscp to access these files)

cloudfront urls are:
live: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=eu-west-1#distribution-settings:E3BY8BZ5S0INQ8
beta: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=eu-west-1#distribution-settings:E3HQWFOMPGY71A


To release:

git pull
npm i
npm run build

static build files will output to \build

copy those over the s3 bucket
(each time we build, the js and css files have a different name. On beta we currently have a growing list of js files that could be deleted. The most important file that gets overwritten is the index.html which references those js/css files.)

to clear the cache,
go to the cloudfront
invalidations tab
copy an existing invalidation (you only need to invalidate /index.html)
invalidate

invalidations cost money, and amazon recomend doing it otherways. I haven't really understood those otherways.

#  Open Referral UK
The Open Referral UK data standard is a consistent way of recording and sharing information about services. 

Currently in the UK most organisations in the public sector (such as local authorities and health, housing and voluntary organisations) have a form of directory that is used to store and list local services. In each locality, directory content is often duplicated across the public sector. 

Open Referral UK defines a standard structure to meet this need for a consistent way of gathering and using data.

## 'Dashboard' page
The route `/dashboard` renders the [data feed dashboard](https://openreferraluk.org/dashboard). This page pulls data from the [service validator API](https://validator.openreferraluk.org/api), which will block all requests other than those coming from the following domains:
```
"http://dev.openreferraluk.org",
"https://dev.openreferraluk.org",
"http://beta.openreferraluk.org",
"https://beta.openreferraluk.org",
"http://openreferraluk.org",
"https://openreferraluk.org",
"https://validator.openreferraluk.org",
"https://exporter.openreferraluk.org",
"https://tools.openreferraluk.org"
``` 

In order to get around CORS issues when accessing this page locally, there are two solutions suggested by Matt from Porism (thanks!):
1. Access a static copy of the JSON at the route `/devdashboard`
2. Point one of the above addresses (likely: `http://dev.openreferraluk.org`) to your local build in your dev environment.
