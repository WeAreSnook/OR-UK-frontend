#  Open Referral UK
The Open Referral UK data standard is a consistent way of recording and sharing information about services. 

Currently in the UK most organisations in the public sector (such as local authorities and health, housing and voluntary organisations) have a form of directory that is used to store and list local services. In each locality, directory content is often duplicated across the public sector. 

Open Referral UK defines a standard structure to meet this need for a consistent way of gathering and using data.
